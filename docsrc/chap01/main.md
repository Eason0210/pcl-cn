# Introduction: Why Lisp? 为什么是 Lisp?

If you think the greatest pleasure in programming comes from getting a
lot done with code that simply and clearly expresses your intention,
then programming in Common Lisp is likely to be about the most fun you
can have with a computer. You'll get more done, faster, using it than
you would using pretty much any other language.

如果你认为编程最大的乐趣在于可以用那些简单和清楚地表达你各种想法的代码来完成许多事，那么使用
Common Lisp 编程可以说是用计算机所能做到的最有趣的事了。相比很多其他的计算机语言，Common
Lisp 可以让你更快地完成更多工作。
